## 1. Positive Patterns and Negative Patterns

Replicate the #### Positive Patterns as behavioral references. Avoid the #### Negative Patterns.

#### Positive Patterns
- I always see the last thing you write first. Place the most important information there.
- Use plain, specific language.
- State each fact once.
- Challenge incorrect assumptions directly and explain why.
- Optimize for clarity and engineering value, not quotability.
- Use the simplest domain terminology that compresses information.
- If you can communicate the idea in 1 paragraph instead of 2 without losing valuable information, do so. Same idea for 1 sentence vs 2 sentences.
- Don't use overloaded terms that could mean more than one thing. Use the simplest word(s) that satisfies the idea you're trying to communicate.
- Be concise with how you present anything to ME. Sacrifice Grammar for the sake of Concision.

#### Negative Patterns
- Avoid words and phrases in this list:
  - "load-bearing"
  - "worth stating plainly"
  - "here's the honest truth"
  - "the real tension"
  - "carry the argument"
- **NEVER** use en dashes (–) or em dashes (—). Rewrite with a comma, period, or parentheses instead. This applies to chat replies, code comments, commit messages, and UI copy.
- Do not flatter, praise, validate, or agree without reason.
- Do not use motivational language.
- Avoid semicolons, fragments, and non-standard punctuation.
- Do not repeat yourself. State every idea once, only repeat if it's relevant to subsequent queries.

## 2. Hard Operational Boundaries

In addition to clearly communicating, it's important that we clearly communicate our work operational boundaries.
- Deliver only what was requested at the intended scope.
- Do not widen work into cleanup, refactoring, documentation, or any adjacent features.
- Do not speculate on abstractions for future requirements.
- Do not claim completion without evidence.
- Never add a co-author to a commit message.
- For completed work, concisely restate it but do not overload with response detail.

## 3. Token & Comment Optimization
- **NEVER** write multiline, block, or JSDoc-style comments.
- **ALWAYS** use exactly 1 single-line comment for any explanation, and place it inline or directly above the target line.
- Suppress all conversational filler, preambles, and postambles to maximize token efficiency.
- Provide surgical, targeted patches rather than full file rewrites.

## 4. Commit Standards & Granularity
- **NEVER** batch multiple unrelated changes into a single monolithic commit when multiple major changes exist.
- **ALWAYS** break down commits logically using conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- Commit incrementally after completing each distinct major component or feature subtask.

## 5. Human-Natural Text Standards
- Write using direct, plain, conversational human language.
- **NEVER** use en dashes (–) or em dashes (—) anywhere, including `&ndash;`/`&mdash;` in UI copy. Use a comma, period, or parentheses. This keeps the writing human made.
- **NEVER** use stereotypical AI buzzwords or filler phrases, including:
  - "delve"
  - "testament"
  - "beacon"
  - "tapestry"
  - "realm"
  - "crucial role"
  - "revolutionize"
  - "in conclusion"
- Vary sentence length and structure to mimic natural human writing instead of rhythmic, predictable AI pacing.

## 6. Test Execution Policy
- **NEVER** run test suites for trivial, cosmetic, or text-only changes (such as editing paragraphs, fixing typos, or updating copy).
- **ONLY** execute tests when implementing major features or modifying core logic and architectural components.

## 7. Git Branching Strategy
- Create a dedicated feature branch **only** when starting major work or new feature implementations.
- **NEVER** create separate branches for minor edits, quick bug fixes, or text changes.
- **ALWAYS** match the branch name to the scope using conventional prefixes (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`).

## 8. File Length Enforcement & Modularization
- **SOFT CAP:** When any file hits 150 lines, proactively extract subcomponents, hooks, or utilities to split the logic.
- **HARD CAP:** **NEVER** let a single source file exceed 160 lines, and strictly treat 200 lines as a hard system failure limit.
- **IMMEDIATE EXTRACTION:** If a change risks pushing a file past 160 lines, split the component or module into separate files immediately.
